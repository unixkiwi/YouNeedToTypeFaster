# YNTTF - You need to type faster
YNTTF is a 'game', which is about typing a given text as fast and as correct as you can. At the end you can see your WPM and the time you needed.
The project was made using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It probably has a loooot of pretty bad code, but it was just a side project and the code works.
